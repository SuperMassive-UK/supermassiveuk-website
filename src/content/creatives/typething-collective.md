Typething is a collective of artists, engineers and makers that develop experimental art installations and design unique participatory experiences. They combine  skills across the disciplines of digital arts, software development, design and fabrication to create interactive installations to showcase at an ever-expanding collection of events, festivals and light shows.

Their artistic philosophy centres around creativity and play, and the idea that, given the right tools and environment, anyone can express themselves and create mesmerising multisensory experiences for others. They seek to instil childlike joy and wonder in their audiences, a universal feeling that transcends age and experience.

Typethingâ€™s most prominent installation is a multi-sensory instrument which puts participants in control of a harmonious blend of sound, light, bubbles and smoke.

Creative play is encouraged through a simple interface featuring a miniature grand piano and control panel with parameters designed for pleasing sonic results that promote experimentation - empowering beginners and virtuosos alike. The unique audio-responsive lighting setup ensures synchronicity, also giving the audience close control over the immersive visuals.

After hours, The Cloud Organ can also transform into an interactive party with the audience invited to make the beats through fully integrated drum machines, synthesisers and microphone effects. Alternatively, DJs can also play, with the piano becoming a strange lighting desk.
