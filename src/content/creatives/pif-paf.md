Pif-Paf is an inventive theatre company with a bold ambition to bring exceptional performance and sculptural art to unexpected places. Operating out of Sheffield and engaging audiences across the UK and internationally, Pif-Paf breaks the traditional boundaries of art by presenting their work outdoors and in non-conventional spaces. This approach not only showcases their commitment to the development of outdoor arts but also ensures their performances and installations are accessible to a wider audience. The company thrives on the collaborative efforts of its artistic directors, Pete Gunson and Eleanor Hooper, along with a dedicated team of freelance performers, makers, and musicians, all contributing to Pif-Paf’s distinct and high-quality visual style.

One of Pif-Paf's signature creations is the Celestial Sound Cloud, a unique interactive installation that combines art, music, and technology in an immersive experience. As audiences move beneath the installation, eye sensors hidden within trigger vocal harmonies and lighting effects, transforming movement into music and light. The sound, featuring artist Eleanor Hooper’s voice, allows participants to play the cloud like an instrument, creating a dynamic and collective musical piece. This installation, adaptable for both indoor and outdoor settings, has been successfully installed in diverse locations, from mature trees to church columns, demonstrating its versatility and the innovative spirit of Pif-Paf.

The Celestial Sound Cloud has captivated audiences at numerous festivals and events since its commissioning in 2016, including appearances at Kendal Calling, Winchester Cathedral's Woolly Hat Fair, and WOMAD, among others. Its ability to foster a sense of community, beauty, and playfulness has been universally acclaimed, offering a space for participants to explore the symbiotic relationship between nature and technology. Pif-Paf's commitment to integrating local musicians into the experience further enriches the installation, making each presentation unique and deeply connected to its venue. The Celestial Sound Cloud stands as a testament to Pif-Paf's vision of art as a medium for exploration, discovery, and engagement, inviting audiences to reconsider their relationship with the natural world through the lens of playful interaction.
