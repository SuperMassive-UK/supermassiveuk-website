Tom Lambert is an innovative sculptural artist known for blending geometric industrial forms with animated light pixels to craft immersive light sculptures. These installations are not just visual experiences but are complemented by specially produced music and special effects, inviting the audience to fully immerse themselves in the artwork. Lambert's creations are designed to stand in stark contrast to their surroundings, whether nestled in a serene forest or juxtaposed against the bustling backdrop of an urban environment. Drawing inspiration from modern architecture, science fiction cinema, and the dynamic sets and lighting seen at music festivals and club venues, Lambert's work seeks to transport its audience to otherworldly realms.

Lambert's sculptures offer more than just a visual spectacle; they are gateways to unearthly wonders that captivate and draw in visitors, urging them to explore and uncover the hidden layers within. These pieces challenge perceptions, encourage momentary reflection, and provoke thoughts about the nature of the experience and its personal significance to each observer. Through his art, Lambert creates transcendent, otherworldly experiences that play with light, colour, and sound, enveloping audiences in an atmosphere of mystery and exploration.

One of Lambert's notable works, featured at Canary Wharf Winter Lights in London in 2023, is "Out of the Dark." This installation consists of two towering structures that act as portals, inviting onlookers into a realm of reflection and contemplation. With a quadraphonic sound landscape that engages the senses, the piece creates a dialogue between the structures, filled with ethereal noises and meticulously chosen audio samples. These soundscapes, unique yet harmonious, craft a sonic environment that encourages interaction and exploration. "Out of the Dark" stands as a message from beyond, connecting visitors with feelings of universal serenity and wonder, embodying Lambert's vision of contrast, immersion, and the boundless possibilities of sculptural art in engaging with the audience on a profound level.
