Tales From The Other Side is an immersive light and shadow theatre that is imagined and hand built by artist Liz von Graevenitz.

Their ethos is about nurturing a sense of freedom and play through creative practice that aims to inspire and encourage imagination. They are able to teach artist lead workshops in shadow puppetry making skills that involve people of all ages and abilities. Tales From The Other Side is not just for children, adults love the process too!

From twilight into the night, the atmosphere comes to life as the stage lights up then the shadow puppet performances commence where all sorts of fantastical stories are brought to the audience.  The sensory ambience has proven to  be a welcoming and experimental space where people with autism have enjoyed magical moments of play and interaction.
